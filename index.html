      <h1>Displaying Playlist:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>A for loop is used to iterate over the list of songs in the playlist.</li>
      <li>Each song is displayed in the user interface, typically with its title and any relevant information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Playing Songs:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Another for loop is used to sequentially play each song in the playlist.</li>
      <li>Playback controls are implemented within the loop to pause, skip, or stop playback based on user input.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Playlist Management:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>For loops may be used to perform operations like shuffling the playlist or removing songs.</li>
      <li>These loops iterate over the playlist, allowing manipulation of its contents.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>User Interaction:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>For loops handle user interactions such as selecting songs, searching for specific songs, or navigating through the playlist.</li>
      <li>Playback controls and other actions are triggered within the loop based on user input.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Error Handling:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In case of errors or unexpected conditions, for loops may be used to gracefully handle exceptions or interruptions during playback.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Usage of Break and Continue Statements in a Music Player Application:</h2>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>
    <strong>Playback Control:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Break:</strong> When the user pauses playback, the music player may use break to exit the loop responsible for playing the current song, effectively pausing playback.</li>
      <li><strong>Continue:</strong> If the user skips a song, the music player can use continue to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next song in the playlist.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Playlist Management:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Break:</strong> When the end of the playlist is reached, the music player might use break to exit the loop responsible for playing songs, effectively stopping playback.</li>
      <li><strong>Continue:</strong> If the music player encounters a song that is unavailable or cannot be played, it can use continue to skip to the next available song in the playlist.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>User Interaction:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Break:</strong> If the user decides to exit the music player application while a playlist is playing, break can be used to exit the loop responsible for managing playback.</li>
      <li><strong>Continue:</strong> When the user performs actions like shuffling the playlist or searching for specific songs, continue can be used to skip certain iterations and proceed with the next action.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Error Handling:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Break:</strong> In case of unexpected errors or interruptions during playback, the music player might use break to exit the loop and handle the error condition.</li>
      <li><strong>Continue:</strong> If the music player encounters an error while playing a particular song, it can use continue to skip the current iteration and proceed with the next song.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
